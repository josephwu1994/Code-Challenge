# First
Go into the app folder
``` 
cd app
```
# Second
## Install
```
$ npm install
```
## Include Google API Key in the ```src/``` folder and name it ```key.js```
Inside `src/key.js`, please include 
```
export default google = { key: YOUR_API_KEY }
```

## Start the app

```
$ react-native run-ios
```
This will take a while. <br>

If you get an error, `on a separate terminal`
## Try
```
$ react-native start -- --reset-cache
```
Then you can start the app again in the original terminal with
``` 
$ react-native run-ios
```
